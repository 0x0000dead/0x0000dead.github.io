### Digital Lab.
Task: 

Assume that you work for the Digital Processing Lab. They ask you to write a program with an input binary matrix A, which contains the pattern to search on other binary matrix B.  
The input file include the size and elements for both A and B. The recognition process consists in scanning row by row (horizontal scanning) the matrix B, when a pattern is located on B you must mark this pattern. To mark a located pattern change 1 to 2 and 0 to * on B.  
The output file of your program will be the matrix B with the located patterns marked.  
### Input
The first line of the input contains the size of A, next lines contains the matrix A row by row, next line contains the size of B and next lines contains the matrix B row by row.
### Output
The output is the matrix B with the located patterns marked.
